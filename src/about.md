Hey 👋 I’m Prateek — a computer science graduate with a strong interest in distributed systems, data-driven applications, and building reliable software at scale.

I’ve spent the last few years working in the blockchain and systems space, where I’ve built and maintained production-grade integrations, worked closely with complex protocols, and shipped features used by real users. I enjoy diving deep into how things work under the hood, whether that’s networked systems, backend architectures, or performance-critical code.

Beyond work, I’m curious by nature and always learning — from new technologies and research papers to hands-on projects that challenge how I think. I value clean design, thoughtful engineering, and teams that care about quality over hype.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym, playing sports, exploring new food spots, or spending time with close friends. I like keeping life balanced: building useful things, staying active, and enjoying the process along the way.

If you’re interested in collaboration, ideas, or just a good tech conversation — feel free to reach out.
